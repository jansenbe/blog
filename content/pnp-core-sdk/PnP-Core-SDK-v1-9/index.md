We've just published a new minor version of the [.NET PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) ([GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk)) with new features to use in your cross-platform SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams projects.

## Build SharePoint Online and Teams solutions in .NET on any platform using PnP Core SDK

The [PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) is an SDK designed to work for Microsoft 365. It provides a unified object model for working with SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams which is agnostic to the underlying APIs being called. The SDK provides an object model that's API agnostic, when you as a developer for example load a model (List, Team, Web,...) the SDK will use the best possible API for loading that model being for the most part Microsoft Graph v1.0 and SharePoint REST. Depending on the needs the SDK will use Microsoft Graph Beta calls and in some cases the CSOM endpoint (client.svc) is called. But the good thing is that all of this is transparent for you as developer! You'll have a consistent development experience regardless of the underlying APIs being called.

The SDK targets .NET Standard 2.0, [.NET 6.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/) and [.NET 7.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7/). Use the .NET 6.0 (LTS) or .NET 7.0 builds if you're using a modern .NET version, use .NET Standard 2.0 for backwards compatibility with .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

## New version of PnP Core SDK â€“ v1.9

Key new features introduced with the 1.9 release are:

- Support for custom cloud environments by allowing to specify custom Azure AD and Microsoft Graph endpoints
- New methods to get an `IFile` by a link (e.g. sharing link) or by id
- Audience targeting support for navigation entries and lists
- Bulk user validation (e.g. for when configuring a user field) via `ValidateUsersAsync` and `ValidateAndEnsureUsersAsync` methods on `IWeb`
- Added `RenameAsync` methods for `IFile` and `IFolder`
- Sharing links can now be updated
- Option to move list items to another path in the same list
- Dropped support for .NET 5
- Improved support for using Moq as test framework
- For the admin library:
  - Additional properties for `ITenantProperties` and `ISiteCollectionProperties`
  - Option to enumerate the site collections behind shared and private Teams channels
  - Support for listing, approving, adding and revoking permission grants for installed applications
  - Support for disabling/enabling the SharePoint principal of the tenant
  - Enumerate Azure ACS principals and SharePoint AddIns
